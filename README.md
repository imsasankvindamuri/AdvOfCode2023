I know this is INSANELY late, but I want to get some practice in and I thought this will be a good warmup before learning Pygame and Unity, along with a Snake Project to dust off the mental cobwebs.
The Plan is Simple:
1. Finish the entirety of this AoC 2023
2. Do a small project of implementing the Snake Game
3. Try to teach myself C++ and Unity, also teach myself RL in the process
4. ????
5. Profit
